        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            If you've ever been to Brenda's French Soul Food in San Francisco, 
            you know how delicious these things are, and for those who haven't, 
            prepare yourself for a mouthful of awesome! I'm not sure the exact 
            measurements they use, but this is my personal version that comes pretty 
            close to the real thing. Looking forward to your feedback and hope 
            you all enjoy!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package crawfish tail meat</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>chopped green onion</li>
            <li>2 (16.3 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough, separated</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix crawfish meat, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, and green onion 
                together in a big bowl.</li>
            <li>Flatten and stretch out 12 biscuits with your hands or a rolling 
                pin until they are rectangular in shape and about 4x5 inches.</li>
            <li>Place a scoop of the crawfish mix in the middle of each flattened 
                biscuit and close all sides around it, working with your hands 
                until all creases are fully sealed and you reach a desired shape.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 
                degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place beignets carefully into the hot oil and fry until they float 
                to the top and are golden brown on both sides, flipping as needed, 
                about 5 minutes total. Remove from oil onto a paper towel-lined 
                plate. Sprinkle tops with paprika and cayenne pepper.</li>
        </ol>
